stackoverflow-answers
=====================

Library of code written to answer StackExchange questions.


Impetus

I started answering questions on StackOverflow and some other
StackExchange sites.  As I was writing code to provide as answers, I
thought I might want to save some of the code I was writing.  I also
wanted to use git again some more.  So, a repo of StackOverflow
answers seemed like a good way to progress on both fronts.
